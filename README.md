## 💫 About Me

🧠 I’m currently working on scaling engineering teams and processes, bringing AI into everyday workflows to improve reliability, speed, and impact across the org.

🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on AI-powered automation, internal developer platforms, and intelligent tooling that helps teams ship faster with fewer bottlenecks.

🤲 I’m looking for help with designing robust AI governance, evaluation frameworks, and monitoring systems so we can safely deploy high-leverage AI solutions in production.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about LLMOps, prompt engineering, vector databases, and retrieval-augmented generation to turn scattered company knowledge into useful AI copilots.

💬 Ask me about being an Engineering Manager at CEPRES, running AI hackathons, and using AI generalist patterns to increase efficiency and output in product and engineering orgs.

⚡ Fun fact: AI agents are my current best friends—I prototype with them daily to automate reviews, generate insights from data, and reduce busywork for my teams.
