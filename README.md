# 💫 About Me:

•	🧠 I’m currently working on scaling engineering teams and processes, bringing AI into everyday workflows to improve reliability, speed, and impact across the org.<br>
•	🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on AI‑powered automation, internal developer platforms, and intelligent tooling that helps teams ship faster with fewer bottlenecks.<br>
•	🤲 I’m looking for help with designing robust AI governance, evaluation frameworks, and monitoring systems so we can safely deploy high‑leverage AI solutions in production.<br>
•	🌱 I’m currently learning more about LLMOps, prompt engineering, vector databases, and retrieval‑augmented generation to turn scattered company knowledge into useful AI copilots.<br>
•	💬 Ask me about being an engineering manager at CEPRES, running AI hackathons, and using AI generalist patterns to increase efficiency and output in product and engineering orgs.<br>
•	⚡ Fun fact: AI agents are my current best friends—I prototype with them daily to automate reviews, generate insights from data, and reduce busywork for my teams.
